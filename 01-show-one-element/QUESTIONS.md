## Questions

---

> If you click the link to reveal more text and then refresh the page, does the text remain revealed, or is it hidden again? Why?

It becomes hidden again.

> Remove `window.onload = function() {` (and the closing `}`) from **global.js**. Does the link still reveal the text? What is the purpose of this code that you've removed?

When you remove it nothing functions. I believe it makes it that upon loading, the functionality is there?
